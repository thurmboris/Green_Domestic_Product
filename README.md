# Green Domestic Product

The Green Domestic Product (GrDP) is a novel indicator designed to remedy some of the shortcomings of GDP. 
The GrDP extends the scope of the GDP to integrate the depletion of natural, social, and human capital. 
Concretely, GrDP is defined as GDP minus the external costs associated with the production of goods and services, including the impacts of the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), air pollutants, and heavy metals.

This repository contains all the data and code used to compute the GrDP for European countries. 
You can read more about the project on the [E4S webpage](https://e4s.center/resources/reports/green-domestic-product/) of the project.

st.header("What is the Green Domestic Product?")

st.write("""
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a valuable indicator measuring the monetary value of all goods and services produced in a country within a given time period. However, the GDP is not and never was an indicator of economic performance and social progress. Already in 1934, Simon Kuznets, who invented the Gross National Product (GNP) – GDP’s predecessor, warned that national income statistics do not measure welfare. Indeed, while economic science is interested in properly managing all resources, the GDP does not encompass the indirect impacts of productive activities such as environmental pollution. Thus, the GDP is not a good measure of the value effectively created because it fails to account for the depletion of natural, social, and human capital associated with economic activities.

st.write("""
Today, the climate crisis requires urgent action to decarbonise our society. However, there is often a perceived dichotomy between promoting economic growth and protecting environmental sustainability. But these two objectives need not be conflicting, as stated in 2009 by the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission:
""")

st.markdown("> What we measure affects what we do; and if our measurements are flawed, decisions may be distorted. Choices between promoting GDP and protecting the environment may be false choices, once environmental degradation is appropriately included in our measurement of economic performance. So too, we often draw inferences about what are good policies by looking at what policies have promoted economic growth; but if our metrics of performance are flawed, so too may be the inferences that we draw.")

st.markdown("""
With E4S, we propose a novel indicator, the Green Domestic Product (GrDP), to remedy some of the shortcomings of GDP. The GrDP is calculated by subtracting the external costs associated with producing goods and services from the standard measurement of GDP. The current scope of the GrDP includes the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), air pollutants, and heavy metals. The impacts covered include climate change, health issues, decrease in crops’ yields and biomass production, buildings degradation, and damages to ecosystems due to eutrophication. You can learn more about the GrDP, including a detailed description of the method used, data scources, and assumptions, on the [E4S webpage Green Domestic Product](https://e4s.center/resources/reports/green-domestic-product/).

GHGs are responsible for climate change, which has a wide range of negative impacts on human society and ecosystems by altering temperature and precipitation patterns. Climate change impacts include, for instance, a decrease in economic and agricultural productivity due to more frequent heatwaves and droughts, the destruction of manufactured capital due to extreme events, and biodiversity loss.

This interactive chart shows the evolution of GHG emissions in European countries, according to various reporting methods: 
- Territorial Emissions: accounts for all emissions from residents and non-residents inside a country. The National Emission Inventory follows the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines and is used as a basis for setting GHGs reduction targets in the context of international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.
- Residential Emissions: accounts for all emissions resulting from the activities of a country’s residents, including the ones abroad.
- Transfer Emissions: emissions generated by the production of goods and services that are imported minus the emissions generated by the production of goods and services that are exported, as calculated in the [Global Carbon Atlas](https://globalcarbonatlas.org/emissions/carbon-emissions/). 
- Footprint Emissions: sum of the residential and transfer emissions. These emissions are often called "consumption-based" since emissions are allocated according to where they were consumed, rather than where they were produced with territorial emissions reporting.

# Subsection: Air pollutant

st.markdown("""
Fossil-fuel combustion and industrial and agricultural processes emit various other air pollutants. Once in the atmosphere, these pollutants can be directly inhaled by humans. They can also react with the environment, creating new harmful substances. Finally, they can contaminate water and soils, and then be ingested by ecosystems and in turn by humans. 

The main air pollutants act as precursors to the creation of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Human exposure to these substances leads to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (e.g., asthma and bronchitis) and excess mortality. Similarly, heavy metals exposure is a cause of health issues such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Lead and mercury can also be responsible for IQ loss. The impacts are not restricted to human health though. Ozone exposure decreases crops’ yields and biomass production in forests. NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>  damages buildings by degrading stone and metalwork. NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> affect ecosystems by modifying the nitrogen balance due to eutrophication. 

This interactive chart shows the evolution of major air pollutants:
- “main” air pollutants: particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC),
- heavy metals: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni).

# Section: External costs
st.header("...but external costs remain significant")    

st.markdown("""
In our context, external costs - or [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) - are the costs of air pollution to society and to the environment. Several methods are used to value externalities. Here is a short overview, and you can find a more detailed description in the methodology report available on the [E4S website](https://e4s.center/resources/reports/green-domestic-product/).

For the main air pollutants and heavy metals, we rely on the damage costs, i.e., the costs incurred by the pollution, such as agricultural production loss due to a decrease in crop yields. Most air pollutants lead to excess mortality. Although valuing excess mortality might raise ethical questions, the alternative – i.e., not accounting for such impacts – is arguably worse. Two techniques can be used to value excess mortality:
- The value of statistical life (VSL) measures how much people are willing to pay for a reduction in their risk of dying from adverse health conditions.
- The value of life-year (VOLY) estimates the damage costs based upon the loss of life expectancy, expressed as potential years of life lost and accounting for the age at which deaths occur. VOLY provides a lower estimate than VSL for health damages.

For greenhouse gases, we rely on avoidance costs, i.e., the costs to prevent externalities by decarbonizing, for two main reasons. First, damage costs are prone to significant uncertainties, with values from the literature ranging from a few euros to several thousand euros per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. Second, international agreements have the goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5-2°C above pre-industrial levels, thus preventing catastrophic climate change impacts. To account for uncertainties in the cost of decarbonization, we estimated the external costs with three values, taken from the European Commission report [Handbook on the external costs of transport (2020)](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9781f65f-8448-11ea-bf12-01aa75ed71a1/language-en): low (63 €2019/tCO<sub>2e</sub>), central (104 €2019/tCO<sub>2e</sub>), and high (524 €2019/tCO<sub>2e</sub>).
